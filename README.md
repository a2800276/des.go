Synopsis
========

Unfortunately, this project has become superfluous since go's standard
library now contains a DES/3DES
[implementation](http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/des/). You should almost
certainly use that. I was too lazy to do all the important stuff
(documentation, test and benchmarking, propaganda) after I finished the
code. This is being kept around only to demonstrate how easy it is to
port C code to go and to stroke my ego...
