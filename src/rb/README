Generate a bunch of random test data via openssl and ruby.
`ruby make_test_data.rb > ../pkg/crypto/des/des_data_test.go`


Currently generate 20 random (corrected for parity) keys each 
for 1,2 and 3DES, as well as 20 DES blocks (8 byte) of data, plus 
some corner case data (all 0x00, 0xff, 0x01, 0x0f and 0xf0)
and formats this data in `go`.

`grep` for 20 in the script and it should be self-explanatory how
to generate even more stresstest keys and data. I don't see the
point myself...
